            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">Let me just start off by saying that I used to “retire” from running in the winter, or go into <mark>hibernation</mark> mode and run on the treadmill all winter long. Unless we got a warm day where it went back above freezing by at least a few degrees, you wouldn’t catch me dead outside in the winter. I’m not a huge fan of the cold, but that wasn’t even really my issue. I was more intimidated by layering properly. I didn’t know how to do it, so I just didn’t. Shorts and a t-shirt on the treadmill all winter are much, much simpler.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">Too much clothing, and then I’d sweat and freeze. Too little clothing, and I’d just freeze right away. I have my run journal to thank for finally figuring it out. Because I track everything, down to the clothes I wear, to the temperatures, wind chills, and precipitation, I was able to go back and figure out what was “just right” for most conditions. Ever since then, I actually enjoy running in the cold! There’s just something about going out for a run while the snow is falling around you that I can’t explain. It’s something you have to experience for yourself if you haven’t. So, let’s get down to what I’ve learned the hard way so that you don’t have to.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;"><strong>What is “Cold?”</strong><br></br>I define “cold” as around 0º Celsius (32º F). I’m sure everyone’s definition is a little bit different, so take that with a grain of salt. Anything warmer than that and I generally don’t worry about base layers, unless there is a really cold wind chill. If it’s colder than 0º, then I start to layer up. Once you go for a couple of winter runs, you’ll figure out your own “layer-up” temperature. (Just for reference purposes, I live in Southern Ontario. It does get cold here, but usually not bitterly cold like in some places.)</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Layers</strong><br></br>Felt-lined tights are usually my bottom base layer. I found some that I liked and bought a few pairs. If it's -5º or above, I’ll usually just throw a pair of shorts on over top. Anything colder than that and all I swap are the shorts for a pair of thin polyester pants to stop the wind. That’s it for the bottom. I went out for a run the other day when it was -32º with the wind chill and my legs didn’t get cold at all.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">As for the top, down to about -5º I just wear a running t-shirt and a thin sweater, or a thin jacket. If the wind is bad, or if it’s colder than that I’ll throw on my Running Room spring jacket over top, and that’s it. If it’s super cold, I’ll swap out the t-shirt for a long sleeve technical shirt, but that’s the only difference. That’s what I wore the other day when it was -32º and I did 7 km without getting cold at all.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">The key to layering is to be a little bit cold as you’re starting your run. If you are warm standing waiting for your watch to connect, you’re overdressed and will be peeling off layers very soon into your run, or sweating through your base layers. If you’re freezing before you start, you may not be able to get back to a comfortable temperature, and that will make for a miserable run.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Hats, Gloves, Buffs, etc</strong><br></br>I don’t get too carried away with accessories in the winter. I’ve got a faceless balaclava with a lower half that folds away. If it’s a bit too warm for the balaclava, I’ll just throw a buff on over my ears and head out. I’ve got a good pair of running gloves, and that’s about it for warm gear. If you buy good gloves, most days you won’t even notice the cold at all. Most days I have to take mine off a few KM into a run.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">As for socks, I just wear the same socks I wear in the summer; Feetures Elites (I’m not sponsored by them, I just really like their socks). Ask around though, everyone has a sock that they will recommend. Try a few of them and see what feels best for you. Everyone’s level of “too cold” is a bit different, but I can’t really say I’ve noticed my feet getting cold with just one pair of socks on. Some runners do double up, but personally, I’ve never tried that.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;"><strong>What About Shoes?</strong><br></br>This is where things get a little complicated. If you're running somewhere where it’s cold, but there’s no snow and it’s dry, you could very well get away with wearing pretty much anything. Just keep in mind most “summer shoes” are often made of mesh, so if there is any snow, you’ll have wet feet pretty quickly.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">If there’s any snow or any chance at all of encountering ice, please leave street shoes in the closet! Find something with some really good lugs on the bottom and something that is advertised as waterproof. It’s not worth risking an injury if you do come across a random patch of ice somewhere. My personal favourite in the winter is the Saucony Peregrine ICE. (I’m not sponsored by Saucony, I just absolutely love their shoes!) I’m sure no matter what brand you prefer, they will have a shoe that is geared toward winter running.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Extra Traction</strong><br></br>No matter what shoes you wear, sooner or later you’ll need some extra grip. Yaktrax Run is my go-to traction aid for any trail run that involves snow or ice. I’ve put a picture below. What if it’s not a trail run though? You don’t want to be running down the sidewalk in the Yaktrax, they would get worn out pretty quickly (ask me how I know).</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">I discovered Yaktrax Quick Trax a couple of years ago and they changed winter running for me. They are super cheap, so it doesn’t matter if you wear them out running down a sidewalk, or down a slippery road. I ran on trails last year that you could have skated on with the Quick Trax. They only have two little carbide spikes on them, but once you figure out the best place to position them on your feet, they are incredible! Since I discovered them I usually only wear my big Yaktrax for trail runs with lots of snow; I find they just help me to stop from slipping every time my foot pushes off against the deep snow.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">I also almost always carry my Gabel hiking poles on trail runs in the winter. It's extra insurance against slipping and falling, and they really help running up hills in the snow. If you’ve never tried running with poles before, I’d recommend giving it a shot in the winter.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Other Things to Consider</strong><br></br>Your route — Winter isn’t the best time to try to do a 50k out and back. Too many things can change in the middle of a run in the winter. If you do need to do 50k, do it in smaller loops around your starting point so that you’re never too far from a safe spot just in case. Always tell someone where you’re planning on running in the winter and what time you plan on being back. Better safe than sorry.<br></br> <br></br><strong>Extra Clothes</strong> — If I’m going out for any run longer than 10 or 15km in the winter, I usually bring my running pack with some extra clothes. A spare pair of socks in case they get wet, an extra base layer or t-shirt in case the first one gets sweaty, and an extra outer layer in case the temperature drops unexpectedly. 9 out of 10 times I won’t need them, but I don’t mind carrying them for the one time I do need to change/layer up more.<br></br> <br></br><strong>Frostbite</strong> — If it’s really cold and windy, any exposed skin could end up getting frostbite. Some people put a thin layer of Vaseline on, but I usually use Squirrel’s Nut Butter. I’ve got a very small tube of it that I throw in my pocket just in case I need to reapply it mid run.<br></br> <br></br><strong>Glasses/Goggles</strong> — If it’s sunny out, don’t forget your glasses! It’s pretty hard to watch your footing when you’re squinting the entire run. If its really windy, or snowing and blowing, I’ll throw on a pair of ski goggles. They also help keep the wind off the upper half of your face.<br></br> <br></br><strong>Phone Battery</strong> — If its really cold out the battery on your phone will die pretty quickly. I try to keep mine as close to my body as I can, but even that only helps a bit when it’s super cold out.<br></br> <br></br><strong>Water </strong>— It’s just as important to hydrate in the winter as it is in the summer, but that isn’t without issue. When it gets really cold, your bottles will freeze. I generally don’t use the bladder in my hydration pack in the winter because of how easily the line freezes up. I use bottles because even if the nozzle freezes, you can take the lid off.<br></br> <br></br><strong>Lights/Reflectors</strong> — If you are out on the roads or sidewalks, it’s a good idea to wear extra reflective gear or lights. It gets dark a lot earlier, so anything that will help you get noticed by vehicles helps to keep you safe. Don’t do what I did and buy all black outwear. The next jacket that I buy will be neon yellow or orange for sure.<br></br> <br></br><strong>Sweat</strong> — I do my best to keep my heart rate down when its really cold out so that I don’t sweat as much. I find that for me, the longer I can go without getting too sweaty, the more I enjoy the run and the farther I can go while still being comfortable.<br></br> <br></br><strong>Don’t Be a Hero</strong> — No matter how much you plan ahead, sometimes the conditions are just unsafe. It’s not the end of the world to have to use the treadmill now and then. If you haven’t got a treadmill, it’s okay to skip a run if the conditions are bad. You can make up for a missed run very easily; if you slip and fall you could miss weeks of training.<br></br>Most important of all, enjoy it!!<br></br>Seriously, have fun! Running in the snow can be an amazing experience! Being the first person down a trail after a fresh snowfall is very refreshing; it almost makes you feel like you’re the first person to ever run there. When it’s really cold out, most people stay inside, so you’ll have a lot fewer people on your route. Throw on a couple of layers and give it a shot if you haven’t already. You may discover that you actually really like it too.</p></div></div></div></section><?php include_once 'Elemental/footer.php'; ?>
