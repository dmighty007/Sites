            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">On my first day at Airbnb, in early 2011, I walked in to see cofounder <a href="https://twitter.com/jgebbia" target="_self">Joe Gebbia</a> building my desk. I had spent three months slowly convincing the fledgling startup that they needed what was called a product manager. Now, Joe encouraged me to settle in and dive deep into the website.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">As I scrolled through the listings I noticed something: Those faces in the reviews? Several were walking around the office. My face became flushed. Had I just made the biggest mistake of my career? Did I join a pint-sized marketplace that was running off of the credit cards of its employees? My anxiety was quickly allayed by CEO & cofounder <a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky" target="_self">Brian Chesky</a> who assured me that employee reviews only made up a small fraction of the 10,000 reviewed listings. I caught my breath.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">What I’d joined, I quickly learned, was a creative team of problem solvers, wholly committed to making this marketplace work. When reviews proved essential to getting bookings, team-members traveled to get the first reviews of many listings. And as the company’s first product manager — hired when it had just eight engineers — I was going to have to think creatively too.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">Marketplaces are notoriously hard to start, but amazing if they work. In my six years at Airbnb, I watched it scale over 100X on every metric: listings, users, revenue, employees, and, yes, sometimes complexity. I joined at an inflection point in the business, when the product was shifting from niche to early adopter, from a marketplace for air mattresses to a truly viable accommodation alternative. As the company boomed, we lived through many more inflection points, even existential challenges. But that creative, “we’ll get through this no matter what” attitude always got us through.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

By the time I joined, those efforts had paid off, and New York made up a significant portion of stays. So how could we replicate the success of New York in other markets?</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">For Airbnb, liquidity on the supply side is crucial. Cofounder <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanblec" target="_self">Nate Blecharczyk</a> is highly quantitative and had determined that 300 listings, with 100 reviewed listings, was the magic number to see growth take off in a market. Observing New York, Paris, and a few other top markets, we saw a step-function change in the rate of bookings growth at 300 listings, the point at which guests had enough options to find a listing that matched their tastes <em>and</em> their travel dates.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">With a clear liquidity goal in mind, we tried everything to get each market — for us, a specific destination like London — to our magic number. Many of these activities were manual efforts like meetups with local hosts, outreach encouraging targeted guests to try hosting, and on-the-ground host referral campaigns. We also latched onto local events that were bigger than us whenever possible. Online campaigns such as “Make $1,000 in one weekend renting your apartment to Oktoberfest attendees” instead of more generic campaigns like “Rent your apartment to strangers” dramatically improved supply-side conversion metrics. And because one of the most powerful ways to bootstrap supply is to guarantee demand, we encouraged employee travel to unreviewed listings.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">Our marketplace was global from day one, but there were numerous benefits to targeting specific geographies over a fixed period of time. We looked for tactics that showed promise, then figured out how to double down and get more sophisticated and scalable. There’s no single technique to credit with Airbnb’s early market growth; the sum of all of these strategies was greater than the parts. And your early course will rarely be linear. At one point, we were ramping up 50 markets simultaneously, and clearly spread too thin. After a moment of truth, we scaled back to a maximum of ten markets at a time.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">Years — and over 4 million listings — later, Airbnb doesn’t need to meet hosts in person anymore; the flywheel is officially spinning. But this bootstrapping mentality became a vital part of our DNA. Marketplaces demand creative and scrappy efforts from the start. Make it part of your culture from the get-go.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">In July 2011, less than 48 hours after it happened, the story of a host’s trashed home was on the front page of the business sections of the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and <em>Financial Times</em>. It created a media firestorm with many predicting the end of Airbnb. We had never encountered such an existential crisis. Advisors told us that we were merely a marketplace and should not get involved in dealings between a guest and host. Our founders fundamentally disagreed. They wanted to restore trust to the community.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">Brian came to me with a crazy challenge: find insurance for our hosts or else we might not survive the next week! We were in a freefall; bookings started to materially decline. I talked to over 20 underwriters and was introduced to board members of the largest insurance companies in the world. No one was willing to go out on a limb for a new type of business and underwrite our risk.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">Three days into the crisis, Brian and I huddled in the office at 1 a.m. with employees sleeping on air mattresses around us. I was out of options. The time had come to take a leap, and I proposed a $5,000 guarantee, backed by Airbnb itself with no insurance to backstop us. Brian, with advice from <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca" target="_self">Marc Andreessen</a>, said, “Can we go bigger?” Brian didn’t want me to edit my imagination even in this stressful time. I tried to calculate all the risk scenarios in my head. But the decision suddenly seemed simple: the risk of doing too little was greater than the risk of doing too much.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-9"><p class="ff3" style="font-size:22px;">We decided that $50,000 was our number. I quickly drafted the ten key markets where we’d launch and what we’d cover (theft and vandalism), then started frantically dialing our outside counsel for his approval. Brian wanted to make the announcement in a few hours. On August 1, 2011, we announced the $50,000 Host Guarantee. Assembling a small team of five, we spent the next two weeks fully operationalizing a program that involved legal, marketing, product, and operations.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

The total exposure risk was over $500 million in potential losses. After getting some sleep, I analyzed every claim. Nothing was blowing up. The announcement had put out the fire, and more importantly, we felt proud of what we had offered to our community. It felt as though we had pulled off the impossible. A few months later, I finally found an underwriter in London that increased the Host Guarantee coverage to $1 million.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="image3 cid-tt612oXwA9" id="image3-5" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

(And when I say copycat, I mean it. We even found our job reqs on their site — some with Airbnb still listed as employer!) The competitor had just received $90 million in funding and ramped up to 400 employees in two months.

First and foremost, that meant we had to be “local.” It was September 2011, and our site was woefully US-centric. In just over three months, I purchased top-level domains for nine countries, assembled a global translation team, contracted with Akamai to reduce site load time, and restructured the UI on every front-facing interaction to support long text strings (crucial when you go from “average” to “<em>durchschnittliche”</em>). We also shifted to a multi-currency payment platform.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="image3 cid-tt612oXwA9" id="image3-5" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

We’d already seen the value of having people on the ground, so we opened offices in eight European cities. Brian cared about the types of people we hired focusing on “missionaries” and not “mercenaries”. Emphasizing culture, we brought in employees who cared about and who wanted to grow the community. We also bought Accoleo and Crashpadder, two smaller players in Europe, to seed supply in Germany and the UK. On the demand side, we had to think broader, with potential travelers coming from all over Europe. In January 2012, to officially launch in Europe, we did a PR blitz to drum up as much press as possible with campaigns like “Rent the Country of Liechtenstein on Airbnb.”</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

We had 200,000 listings now. Edge cases that had once happened a few times a day were now happening 50 or 100 times a day. Reservation cancellations (and alterations, refunds, resolutions between guests and hosts) were all still handled by email, then manually implemented by a customer support rep.

The cost of this second option would not only affect the bottom line, but also the complexity and culture of the organization.

And one clear bottleneck emerged: for a guest, the worst experience was getting no response to a booking request. In fact, they would try again less than a quarter of the time, far less than if the host had just said no. We were losing guests to a false impression that there was no liquidity in the market for them. For years, we’d offered an alternate, but largely unused, booking model called Instant Book. We were initially against promoting it because we wanted to give hosts flexibility but realized that the hosts who implemented Instant Book engaged with the product more. It was time to dust it off.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

First, we needed to convince our hosts that guests accepted through Instant Book would be safe. We began building Verified ID, the product we now use to confirm guest identification in greater fidelity. Using measures including ID scanning, name match to an offline piece of information, and fraud detection machine learning models, we built more trust in the platform, providing confidence to hosts that their guests would be on good behavior.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

Don’t fear them, and know that you will get through them. Airbnb’s inflection points are when the team discovered its ethos and when we created unique solutions to seemingly immense challenges. Airbnb is a wildly collaborative place that has pushed my thinking about what is possible, working backward from the ideal solution. I’ve come to realize that the far out ideas are possible, it just takes dedication to solve any problem that comes your way. Tackling the right problems at the right time ultimately determines the growth trajectory of a marketplace, and the most crucial contribution of any startup leadership team is understanding what problems to address and when. So always take lessons from former and current marketplace successes like Airbnb, but find your own path too.</p></div></div></div></section><section data-bs-version="5.1" class="content5 cid-tt5UseJ9wk" id="content5-4" style="padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
